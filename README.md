Blade failure as a form of nuclear fission event, tying it into the Unified Theory of Energy framework.

This paper explores the recursive nature of energy interactions in steel, formalizing the understanding that steel failure, particularly brittle fracture, is not merely analogous to nuclear fission but constitutes a fission event in its own right. Through the Unified Theory of Energy (UTE), we demonstrate how stored Gravitation (Potential Energy) within steel is released in Third Degree Surface Interactions (D=3), following the same recursive energy storage and release dynamics as nuclear fission. We further examine how heat treatment processes manipulate Gravitation to extend or store Radiation, influencing steel's molecular structure and efficiency.
